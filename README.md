# Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019 ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§
Dataset Source: Kaggle

## Overview ðŸŽ¯
This project aims to analyze the Top 50 Spotify songs of 2019 using Python, performing data visualization and machine learning techniques to predict song popularity. The goal is to explore and understand the dataset, visualize key insights, and build a machine learning model that predicts the popularity of songs based on various musical features.

## Project Workflow ðŸ“‹
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Converted all column names to lowercase for consistency.
Calculated the number of songs per genre and artist.
Handled missing values by filling them with appropriate values.
Data Visualization:

Visualized the data using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations.
Bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps were used to depict various aspects of the dataset, such as genre distribution, correlation between features, and artist dominance.
Machine Learning:

Built machine learning models to predict the popularity of songs.
Applied algorithms like Linear Regression and Naive Bayes to predict popularity based on features like energy, danceability, and loudness.
Compared actual and predicted popularity to evaluate model performance.
Results Visualization:

Visualized the results to compare the actual and predicted popularity of tracks.
Presented the results through scatter plots and regression lines for clear understanding.
Key Insights ðŸŽ¶
Genre and Artist Analysis: Identified the most popular genres and artists in the dataset.
Correlation Heatmap: Showed relationships between musical features like energy, danceability, and loudness.
Popularity Prediction: Implemented a machine learning model to predict the popularity of songs, achieving reasonable accuracy.
Conclusion ðŸ“ˆ
This project provided an in-depth analysis of the Top 50 Spotify songs of 2019 and successfully implemented a predictive model for song popularity. The visualizations and machine learning models offer valuable insights into what makes certain songs more popular than others.

Final Thoughts ðŸ’­
Listening to music while coding always makes the process more enjoyable! For me, itâ€™s Spotify all the way. How about you? ðŸŽ§ðŸ˜Š
